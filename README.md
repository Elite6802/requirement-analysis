# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository serves as a structured documentation of the Requirement Analysis phase for a Booking Management System. 
The purpose of this repository is to provide a clear foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and organizing both functional and non-functional requirements, use cases, and acceptance criteria. 
It also includes visual representations of system interactions using diagrams to ensure clarity and alignment with business and user needs.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of systematically identifying, documenting, and evaluating the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It serves as a bridge between the client’s vision and the development team’s implementation, ensuring that the final product aligns with business objectives and user requirements.

### Importance in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the SDLC because it:

1. **Defines Clear Objectives:** Establishes what the system must achieve, reducing ambiguity and misunderstandings between stakeholders and developers.
2. **Identifies Functional Requirements:** Specifies the features and functions the system must provide to meet user needs.
3. **Determines Non-Functional Requirements:** Captures quality attributes such as performance, reliability, scalability, and security.
4. **Minimizes Project Risks:** Detects potential issues, gaps, or conflicts early, preventing costly revisions during later stages.
5. **Supports Effective Planning:** Provides a solid foundation for designing, developing, testing, and deploying the system.
6. **Ensures Stakeholder Alignment:** Confirms that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of system requirements, leading to higher satisfaction.

In summary, Requirement Analysis is the cornerstone of successful software development. By thoroughly analyzing and documenting requirements, development teams can build systems that effectively meet business goals, provide value to users, and reduce the risk of project failure.
